Time and work required.

In the meantime why not try this SDK and provide me with some feedback: 
Kinetis SDK: http://www.freescale.com/tools/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/development-platforms-with-mbed/software-development-kit-for-kinetis-mcus:KINETIS-SDK?tid=redKINETIS_SDK

Also I read that there is a standalone flash tool called swddude:
https://github.com/cbiffle/swddude



There are some guide to flashing Kinetis MCU here:
