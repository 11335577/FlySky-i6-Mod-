iA6B Voltage Sensor Mod

This mod of the ia6b receiver allows you to obtain flight pack voltage readings (3s/4s packs)
and send the voltage value to the i6 transmitter

It is better than the standard 5v reading the i6 provided

and

it means you do not need the 
FlySky FS-CVT01
Turnigy TGY-CVT01
Turnigy TGY-AVT01


The iA6B mod: it's very accurate , whitin 0.01V. Need to melt (or cut) the plastic of the pins with soldering iron (or dremmel/knife), or maybe easier to sacrifice an ibus pin.
Tried with 3s, the voltage divider is 38.4K + 10K, feel free to try on 4s. Some hot glue for fixing the wire is recommended .
