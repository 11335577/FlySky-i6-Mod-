# 6 position switch modification

![Ready modification](https://github.com/piodabro/FlySky-i6-Mod-/blob/master/6-pos-switch-mod/ready.jpg)

## What you need

1. 6 position 1 pole rotary switch, something like this:

2. Five 1k ohm resistors.

3. Screwdriver

4. Something to open casing.

## How to do this

1. Remove batteries and unscrew all screws on the bottom.

2. Open casing, be careful of wires connected to battery case, disconnect it from main board.

3. Remove the potentiometers knobs and loosen them, then remove potentiometers. You can disconnect them from mainboard.

4. Remove silver cover.

5. Remove potentiometer holder marked on a picture but on the second one.

6. Make new hole for switch (centered on removed holder), do not drill the original hole.

7. Solder 5 resistors to switch like on picture (you can bend switch's pins).

8. Unsolder wires from removed potentiometer and solder them in the same order to switch. See picture above.

9. Mount switch and potentiometer on places, fasten them (but do not mount silver cover). Keep potentiometer and cover in safe place.
Connect back potentiometer wires.

10. Close the casing (remember to connect back battery case to mainboard). Tighten the screws.

## Results

Now you have 6 position mode switch. Setup replaced VR to mode channel.
For APM (ArduCopter) modes set End Points to: Low - 80%, High - 70%.

Have fun.
